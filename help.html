<h1>Software for the interpretation of high-resolution mass spectra in gas chromatography</h1>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Electron ionization mass spectrometry (EI-MS) is widely used in combination with gas chromatography to obtain informative mass spectra that allow one to propose the structure of a molecule. Typically, EI-MS is used with a low-resolution mass detector. However, it is also possible to use EI-MS with a high-resolution mass detector, such as a time-of-flight or an Orbitrap. Many software packages allow one to effectively interpret collision cell fragmentation mass spectra (high resolution), but such mass spectra differ significantly from EI-MS mass spectra, mainly in that the fragment ion peaks do not have an isotopic distribution, as well as a more limited set of fragmentation pathways. Software for working with EI-MS mass spectra is most often focused only on working with low mass spectral resolution. This software package allows one to automatically interpret EI-MS mass spectra in automatic mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic molecular formula assignment based on accurate m/z</li>
<li>Physically based molecular formulas of fragments, determination of the smallest number of bonds that need to be broken to obtain a given fragment</li>
<li>Automatic search for isotopic peaks for each fragment ion, assessment of the quality of the observed isotopic distribution</li>
<li>Search for a molecular ion, and ions [M-H+], [M-2H+], interpretation of the corresponding group of peaks</li>
<li>Estimation of the fraction of the total ion current, which is correctly interpreted at different &quot;levels&quot; of explanation</li>
<li>Fully automatic batch processing of mass spectra, output files in CSV format (comma-separated files)</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Building a list of molecular formulas of possible fragments</h2>
<p>The structure of a molecule is considered a graph whose vertices are &quot;heavy&quot; (non-hydrogen) atoms and whose edges are bonds. Hydrogen atoms are considered in an &quot;implicit&quot; form - as a property of the corresponding &quot;heavy&quot; atom. All possible subgraphs (substructures) formed by &quot;cutting&quot; 1, 2, or 3 edges of the graph are considered. It is assumed that of the resulting fragments, only one carries a charge, the rest are &quot;neutral&quot; losses. The cleavages of all bonds and all possible cleavages of pairs and triplets of bonds are considered. Unlike the popular CFM-EI algorithm, we do not make an exception for bonds in rings. To break a ring, it is necessary to break at least 2 bonds; breaking one bond in a ring does not lead to the formation of fragments whose molecular formula differs from the original one. Thus, a set of molecular graphs corresponding to fragments is obtained. It should be noted that rearrangements that do not affect the molecular formula are not considered. For example, if we break two adjacent bonds in a benzene ring, then in our algorithm we get a linear fragment containing 5 carbon atoms. In practice, this fragment is cyclic, but since we do not consider a tree of fragmentations, but consider a one-time break of several bonds, then these rearrangements do not affect the m/z of the fragment.</p>
<p>Then, for each obtained &quot;fragment ion&quot; (molecular formula), the following rearrangements are considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Migration of hydrogen atoms. We consider all possible variants of the number of hydrogen atoms in a range from x - maxHLoss to x + maxHDrift, where x is the initial number of hydrogen atoms in the corresponding fragment (based on the original structure). We consider non-local &quot;jumps&quot; of hydrogen atoms and do not try to analyze where they are attached. However, fragment ions that obviously contradict the number of valences, for example, CH5+ or C2H7O+, are excluded from consideration.</li>
<li>Migration of fluorine atoms. Only &quot;local&quot; migrations of no more than maxFMigration atoms into a fragment ion from neutral loss are considered. The number of migrating fluorine atoms is limited by the total number of fluorine atoms linked to the atoms to which the broken bonds belong. For example, when bond 1 in Figure A is broken, no more than 2 additional fluorines can jump into the ion. Also considered is the loss of no more than maxFMigration of fluorines by a fragment ion</li>
<li>The loss of no more than one methyl, chlorine, bromine, iodine. At the same time, 1 methyl and 1 chlorine, for example, can be lost, but not 2 chlorines. We are talking about additional losses, in addition to the &quot;main&quot; breaking of 1-3 edges in the graph. Thus, theoretically, C+ can be obtained from CCl4 with three &quot;main&quot; breaking bonds</li>
<li>Transformation of the nitro group NO2 into O (NO loss)
Figure B shows examples of fragment molecular formulas that can be formed (maxHLoss = 3; maxHDrift=2)</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Peak explanation algorithm</h2>
<p>The software tries to explain EACH peak (including isotopic peaks, we go through all peaks) of the mass spectrum according to the explanation levels 0-3. If there is a possible molecular formula for a peak (with an accuracy of mzThreshold) among the fragments listed in possibleIons, then this peak has an explanation level of 1 or higher. If such a formula is not found, then it gets a level of 0. Sometimes this can happen when several peaks overlap, and the centroid is significantly shifted from the real m/z of each of the peaks. After finding the molecular formula to which the peak corresponds, an isotopic distribution is considered for this peak, and for each peak of the isotopic distribution its theoretical intensity is calculated. If it is less than intensityThreshold, then we do not look for this isotopic peak. Otherwise, we look for an isotopic peak. For each isotopic peak with a theoretical intensity higher than intensityThreshold, we perform the following operations. If such a peak is in the spectrum (with an accuracy of mzThreshold), then we look at its intensity. If it differs from the theoretical one by no more than absoluteDifferenceForIsotopic <em>OR</em> by no more than percentDifferenceForIsotopic percent (the theoretical intensity is in the denominator when calculating the percentage error!) then we mark this peak as 3 (perfect), otherwise as 2 (found but not perfect). If the isotopic peak peak_iso is not found (with an accuracy of mzThreshold), then a search is performed for a more intense (intensity higher than the sought theoretical intensity of the isotopic peak) peak found_peak in the spectrum, such that Math.abs(mz_found_peak - mz_peak_iso) / mz_peak_iso &lt; (1 / resolution), i.e. peak with which the original isotopic peak overlapped, then the isotopic peak is labeled as 2. As a result, the original peak whose interpretation was performed is labeled with explanation level 3 if ALL isotopic peaks (with theoretical intensity above intensityThreshold) are labeled as 3. The peak whose interpretation was performed is labeled with explanation level 2 if ALL isotopic peaks (with theoretical intensity above intensityThreshold) are labeled as 2 or 3. Otherwise, it is labeled as 1.</p>
<h2>4. Algorithm for searching and explaining molecular ion</h2>
<p>Algorithm for searching for a molecular ion. The peaks M+, [M-H+], [M-2H+] .... [2-xH+] where x is maxHLostMI, are searched for. For each, if the EXACT mass is found (with an accuracy of mzThreshold), then the corresponding peak gets level 1. Unlike the explainPeaks method, where all the peaks of the spectrum (both the main isotopic and minor, for example 13C) were considered one by one, here at the first stage only the main, most intense peaks of the isotopic distribution are taken. Then all the isotopic peaks are searched for this peak. For each isotopic peak. If such a peak is in the spectrum (with an accuracy of mzThreshold), then we look at its intensity. If it differs from the theoretical one by no more than absoluteDifferenceForIsotopic <em>OR</em> by no more than percentDifferenceForIsotopic percent (the theoretical intensity is in the denominator when calculating the percentage error!) then we mark this peak as found3 (perfect), otherwise as found2 (found but not perfect). If the isotopic peak peak_iso is not found (with an accuracy of mzThreshold), then a search is performed for a peak found_peak in the spectrum, such that Math.abs(mz_found_peak - mz_peak_iso) / mz_peak_iso &lt; (1 / resolution), i.e. peak with which the original isotopic peak overlapped, then the isotopic peak is labeled as found2. Next, for the entire ion, we calculate the fraction of the ion current of the isotopic distribution labeled as found2 and as found3 (including the intensity of the main peak from which we started, it is always labeled found3). If the fraction of the intensity labeled as found3 exceeds fractionIsotopicThreshold, then the corresponding peak is labeled as explained at level 3. If this is not true, then if the sum of the fractions of the intensities labeled as found2 and found3 exceeds fractionIsotopicThreshold, then the corresponding peak is labeled as explained at level 2.</p>
<h2>5. Levels of explanation and interpretation of the results obtained</h2>
<p>In general, three levels of identification are considered for each peak.</p>
<p>Level 1 - the molecular formula is selected, but some isotopic peaks are not found at all<br>Level 2 - isotopic peaks merge with other peaks. For example, the 13C peak of some ion X is superimposed (taking into account the resolution) on the main peak X + H. At not very high resolutions, such peaks may not be separated. This also includes cases of &quot;incorrect&quot; isotopic peak intensity, differing from the theoretically calculated one. This can also be caused by superposition and other factors.<br>Level 3 - all main isotopic peaks are observed correctly, up to the accuracy of mass determination.</p>
<p>Important! <strong>The fact that the peak is identified with an accuracy of 2 or 1 does NOT mean that there is something chemically wrong with it.</strong> It may simply be an overlapping of peaks. The fact that the peak is NOT identified (level 0) means that a non-standard\unexpected rearrangement has occurred, or that the peak is an impurity, or that the identification is incorrect. Peaks with level 2 and 1 require manual review. For a peak with level 3, you can be very sure that it does not contradict the assumed structure. The overlap of the 13C[M-H+] and [M+] peaks is very common of a molecular ion. In these cases, one should especially not mistakenly perceive explanation levels 1 and 2 as indicating incorrect identification.</p>
<p>The program shows for each peak the minimum number of bond breaks required to obtain such a molecular formula. Peaks marked as &quot;all_fragments&quot; are most likely the result of unusual rearrangements or there is something wrong with them. Another quality metric (very simple) that the program calculates is the fraction of the total ion current in area significantly above the heaviest isotopic peak of the molecular ion. This indicates an impurity or incorrect identification. </p>
